This is the distribution of the ENVIRON module for Quantum ESPRESSO.
These are the steps to compile Quantum ESPRESSO with the Environ module,
for more information on installation and usage of the module, please
check the web site http://www.quantum-environment.org/

The installation procedure assumes that the Environ directory has been
placed in the main Quantum ESPRESSO directory. All the installation steps
need to be performed from the main Quantum ESPRESSO directory.

Preliminary steps:

   -1) configure QE following the standard procedure (running
          ./configure from QE main dir should be enough in most cases)
    0) compile QE without the Environ module (e.g. running
          make pw from QE main dir)

If there are problems with the preliminary steps, look up for solutions
on the PW-forum or refer to the Quantum ESPRESSO documentation and web site
http://www.quantum-espresso.org/

    1) modify the make.inc file generated by ./configure by adding the
       -D__ENVIRON flag to the MANUAL_DFLAGS variable
    2) run the QE script addonpatch.sh with the -patch option
          ./install/addsonpatch.sh Environ Environ/src Modules -patch
    3) run the Environ installation script with the -patch option
          ./Environ/patches/environpatch.sh -patch
    4) run the QE script to regenerate modules' dependencies
          ./install/makedeps.sh
    5) re-compile, e.g.
          make all
    6) run executables with -environ flag, e.g.
          pw.x -environ < pw.in > pw.out

To clean up the compilation with Environ follow these steps:

    1) modify the make.inc file generated by ./configure by removing the
       -D__ENVIRON flag from the MANUAL_DFLAGS variable
    2) run the QE script addsonpatch.sh with the -revert option
          ./install/addsonpatch.sh Environ Environ/src Modules -revert
    3) run the Environ installation script with the -revert option
          ./Environ/patches/environpatch.sh -revert
    4) run the QE script to regenerate modules' dependencies
          ./install/makedeps.sh
    5) be sure to remove objects, modules and executables
          make clean
