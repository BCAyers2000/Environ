This is the distribution of the ENVIRON module for Quantum ESPRESSO.
These are the steps to compile Quantum ESPRESSO with the Environ module,
for more information on installation and usage of the module, please
check the web site http://www.quantum-environment.org/

If there are problems with the QE compilation steps, look up for solutions
on the PW-forum or refer to the Quantum ESPRESSO documentation and web site
http://www.quantum-espresso.org/

Installation procedure:

* from QE root directory
   
    1) configure QE installation with
            ./configure
            - should be enough in most cases

* from Environ root directory (placed in the QE root directory) 
    
    1) configure Environ with
            ./configure
            - should be enough in most cases
    
    2) install QE + Environ 2.0 with
            
            make install-QE+Environ

            a) select QE package(s)
            b) select number of cores (for parallel compilation)
            c) (optional) pre-compile QE without Environ (for the more cautious)
            
            * compilation will write logs to Environ/install
            * compilation will terminate if errors are detected
            * NOTE: if pre-compiled, QE re-compilation will only update 
                    the patched files (relatively quick)
    
    3) run executables with -environ flag, e.g.
            
            pw.x -environ < pw.in > pw.out

To clean up the compilation with Environ:

    1) uninstall QE + Environ 2.0 with
            
            make uninstall-QE+Environ
            
            - (optional) confirm cleaning of QE

      * for more flexible cleaning, see Environ/Makefile

The above instructions refer to Environ v2.0 installed on QE-6.3 and later versions
For previous versions of QE (namely QE-6.1.X and QE-6.2.X) please refer to the 
instructions on the website:
