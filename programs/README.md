# Environ stand-alone programs

`driver.f90` to run custom calculations using Environ

The driver is a minimal program designed to call custom routines for custom Environ runs. <br> Users may report interest in additional custom functionality by providing calculation detail <br> to olivieroandreussi@unt.edu or by forking the Environ repo and submitting a pull request <br> for the custom code.

<br>

# Installation

## Environ compilation

The standalone programs require an Environ compilation. For details on how to compile <br> Environ, see the main [`README.md`](../README.md) file in the root directory.

## Stand-alone program compilation

With Environ compiled, from `Environ/programs`, run

    make driver

to compile the respective program.

<br>

# Using the driver

    make avail

to see available calculations.

    make usage name=name-of-calculation

for specific execution instructions.

# Calculation details

## `from_cube`

Computes environment contributions to properties of a "frozen" density given as a cube file

### Requirements

- Environ input file and cube file names may be provided as command-line arguments <br> (see calculation usage for details)

- Environ is unable to determine exactly the energy cutoff used in the calculation that <br> produced the cube file. Though an algorithm for slightly overestimating the cutoff <br> value is implemented in Environ, we recommend the user to provide the cutoff value <br> as `env_ecut` (Ry) in the &ENVIRON section of the input. This value can be obtained <br> from prior knowledge of the system, or by running convergence testing w.r.t total <br> energy difference

- atomic charges must be provided in the cube file header. These depend on the type of <br> calculation that produced the cube file. Replace `charge` with the atomic charge of the <br> corresponding species
