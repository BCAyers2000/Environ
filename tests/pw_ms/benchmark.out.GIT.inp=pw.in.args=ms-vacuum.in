     Parallel version (MPI), running on     1 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     22833 MiB available memory on the printing compute node when the environment starts
 
     Reading input from pw.in

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  4
 
     Reading input from environ.in:
     * using electronic solvent mode
     * setting boundary derivatives method to SCCS default
     
     Message from routine setup:
     using ibrav=0 with symmetry is DISCOURAGED, use correct ibrav instead

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used
