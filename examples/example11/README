This example shows how to use pw.x to model a charged slab embedded in a semiconductor. 
In particular, the electrical diffuse layer is 
modeled as a classical charge distribution, as obtained from the solution of 
the Poisson-Boltzmann equation under Mott-Schottky (MS) condidtions. 

The calculation is a single SCF calculation of a Si slab. The surrounding
semiconductor is treated as a continuum dielectric according to the Self-consistent
Continuum Solvation (SCCS) model of O. Andreussi, I. Dabo and N. Marzari,
J. Chem. Phys. 136, 064102 (2012). 

The example compares different doping densities as
described in XX. 
The following doping densities are considered here:
 1D.16, 1D.17, 1D.18 cm^-3 

As the doping density increases less distance and potential drop is needed
to compensate the high charge region of the explicit slab.

A planar error-function-shaped 2D function is employed 
to define the semiconductor cavity.

Only open boundary conditions are allowed for the calculations including the
electrolyte. The real-space quadratic correction of the electrostatic
potential (pbc_correcton='parabolic', see I. Dabo et al. Phys. Rev. B 77, 
115139 (2008)) is required. The method has been coupled to the SCCS model 
in order to remove PBC in simulations of partially periodic systems in the 
presence of a continuum solvent, as described by O. Andreussi and N. Marzari 
Phys. Rev. B 90 245101 (2014).

A rough explanation of the different electrolyte-related keywords is provided 
in the run_example.sh file.
