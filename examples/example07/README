This example shows how to use pw.x to calculate the energy of a water 
cluster using a solvent-aware interface (thanks to Nicolas HÃ¶rmann for 
the structure). This feature is particularly useful to model branched/
open/porous systems, where pockets that are too small to fit a solvent 
molecule should remain dielectric-free. 

Two calculations are carried out. The first calculation includes
a standard interface between the quantum mechanical and the continuum
region, such that the dielectric unphysically fills the small pocket 
in between the  water molecules. The second calculation models instead a 
solvent-aware interface, which prevents the dielectric continuum to 
enter the central 'hole' of the cluster.

A rough explanation of the different solvent-aware related keywords 
is provided in the run_example.sh file.
