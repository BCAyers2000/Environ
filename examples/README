example01: pw.x
           calculation of total solvation free energy of an isolated molecule including electrostatic/
           cavitation/PV contributions. The solvation cavity is defined according to the revised-SCCS.
example02: pw.x
           same as example01, but the solvation cavity is constructed from atomic-centered
           interlocking spheres ("soft-spheres").
example03: pw.x
           use of different periodic boundary correction schemes for charged isolated systems
	   in vacuum and in solution: Martyna-Tuckerman or Point-Counter-Charge (parabolic).
example04: pw.x
           use of parabolic correction for periodic boundary conditions in
           neutral and charged 2D systems (slab).
example05: pw.x
           use of external classical charge distribution (planar) to model Helmholtz layer
	   above a charged 2D system.
example06: pw.x
           same as example05, but a diffuse electrolyte distribution is accounted for through the
           solution of the linearized-Poisson-Boltzmann equation.
example07: pw.x
           use of the solvent-aware interface to prevent the dielectric to penetrate in regions that
           should remain solvent-free.
example08: pw.x turbo_lanczos.x
           calculation of the optical spectrum of a molecule in vacuum and in solution (only dielectric)
example09: pw.x turbo_davidson.x
	   calculation of the optical spectrum of a molecule in vacuum and in solution (only dielectric)
example10: cp.x (only for QE-5.3.0 and later versions)
	   calculation of the total solvation free energy of an isolated molecule
           including electrostatic/cavitation/PV contributions
