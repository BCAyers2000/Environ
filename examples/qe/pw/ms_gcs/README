This example shows how to use pw.x to model a charged semiconductor electrode
in contact with a solution.


In particular, the algorithm tries to determine the voltage for a given electrode
away from the flatband potential as a function of charge on the electrode.
The algorithm is trying to optimize the charge distribution between the surface states
of the system (modeled here as the DFT slab) and the bulk semiconductor 
which is modeled using a Mott-Schottky solution to the Poisson-Boltzmann equation.

for full details. 

In practice, the callculation runs similarly to an ionic relaxation, where multiple scf
cycles are run, each step trying to optimize the charge distribution between the two
regions such that the Fermi levels are close to equilibrium.

The surrounding solution is treated as a continuum dielectric according to the Self-consistent
Continuum Solvation (SCCS) model of O. Andreussi, I. Dabo and N. Marzari,
J. Chem. Phys. 136, 064102 (2012). 


Only open boundary conditions are allowed for the calculations including the
electrolyte. The real-space quadratic correction of the electrostatic
potential (see I. Dabo et al. Phys. Rev. B 77, 
115139 (2008)) is used. The method has been coupled to the SCCS model 
in order to remove PBC in simulations of partially periodic systems in the 
presence of a continuum solvent, as described by O. Andreussi and N. Marzari 
Phys. Rev. B 90 245101 (2014).
