This example shows how to use pw.x to calculate the electrostatic
solvation energy for a water molecule in water using a field-aware
soft sphere interface defined by the electrostatic field at the
interface normal and the atomic positions, according to
M Truscott, O Andreussi, J. Phys. Chem. B 2019, 123, 16, 3513â€“3524

The field_aware keyword is required to turn on field-aware effects
and is implemented for the "soft-spheres" interface model
as described in G. Fisicaro, L. Genovese, O. Andreussi, S. Mandal,
N.N. Nair, N. Marzari, and S.Goedecker, J. Chem. Theor. Comput. 13, 3829 (2017).

Mind that the parabolic correction (or point-countercharge method)
is used for both the calculation in vacuum and in the solvent.

A rough explanation of the different keywords of the solvation model is 
in the run_example.sh file.
