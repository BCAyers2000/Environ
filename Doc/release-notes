New in development version:

  * 

Problems fixed in development version:

  * modified the local arrays in compute_convolution_fft to avoid 
    large automatic arrays written on the stack (segmentation fault on
    Mac with default compilation options, i.e. small stack) 

Incompatible changes in development version:

  *

Known problems in Environ 1.0 :

  * testset is not fully consistent between parallel and serial execution,
    and with different compilers
  
  * test pw_water/water-anion-sccs-default has convergence issues

  * charged systems in PBC without jellium show small differences between
    pcb and iter solvers

  * forces in dielectric embedding for charged systems and PBC have a 
    small error

  * sqrt preconditioner for dielectric embedding only works for analytic 
    boundary_core

  * alternative preconditioning schemes for dielectric embedding 
    are not stable, do not converge
